<h2>About</h2>
<p>tellr mobile (iOS/Android) React Native dating app. <br> Done in React Native, Apollo Client, and Typescript.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/arf1e/tellr_server">Backend Repository ></a>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
I am making this app for those who struggle with endless swiping dating apps and inevitably falling into "what do I say now?" struggle after finally getting a match. The whole idea of the app is to make some kind of "blind date" between users and give them some topics they could start their conversation with.<br>
<h3>Process</h3>
The only data you have about the user is his/her profile picture and a bio. Based on that information, you have to tell (yep, that's where the app name is from) your first impression of the user, and guess how the user would answer a few quick questions (for example: <i>"What motivates and inspires you?"</i>). In each question you are provided with three choices: one of those is exactly the user's answer, and the other two are either another user's answers or a response generated by an AI.
<br/>
You can guess 100% right, you can guess 100% wrong, the match will be created either way if you like each other. But this process makes sure you will have some topics to talk about so you won't be staring at the blank chat screen.</p>

<h2>Technology choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>React Native</b></p>
    <p>Lets me use my React.js skills to develop native mobile apps for both iOS and Android. Gets hard when it comes to upgrading react-native versions or working with native dependencies, but RN has large community where I can find all the answers ðŸ‘€</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Typescript</b></p>
    <p>Helps to avoid typos and stupid mistakes, neat autocomplete as a nice bonus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Apollo Client</b></p>
    <p>It has its caching in place - most of the time I don't need to store any server responses in my global store, focusing only on UI logic.</p>
    <p>I also like how flexible their hooks are. On this project I like to build Finite State screens on top of graphQL hooks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Redux (Toolkit)</b></p>
    <p>All-time classics when it comes to React state management. Toolkit lets me conveniently divide my redux logic into slices. I also use redux-persist library for store persistance between app usage sessions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
